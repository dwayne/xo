A [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) library for
[Tic-tac-toe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

The code is well documented and fully tested, so please have a
[read of the documentation](http://rubydoc.info/github/dwayne/xo) and have a
[look at the tests](https://github.com/dwayne/xo/tree/master/spec/xo).

My implementation of the [Minimax algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#Minimax_algorithm_with_alternate_moves)
might be a little different than what you've seen before. It uses symmetry to
significantly reduce the search space and in so doing we get good
[performance out of the algorithm](#performance-of-the-minimax-algorithm).
However, I still want to get it under 1 second. I'd love to hear your thoughts
on how I can make it happen. Have a
[look](https://github.com/dwayne/xo/blob/master/lib/xo/ai/minimax.rb#L23).

## Installation

```
$ gem install xo
```

## Example usage

Managing the grid yourself.

```ruby
require 'xo'
include XO

g = Grid.new('xx oo')

puts g # =>  x | x |
       #    ---+---+---
       #     o | o |
       #    ---+---+---
       #       |   |

evaluator = Evaluator.instance

evaluator.analyze(g, Grid::X) # => { status: :ok }

g[1, 3] = Grid::X
evaluator.analyze(g, Grid::X) # => { status: :game_over,
                              #      type: :winner,
                              #      details: [{
                              #        where: :row,
                              #        index: 1,
                              #        positions: [[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]]
                              #      }]
                              #    }

evaluator.analyze(g, Grid::O) # => { status: :game_over,
                              #      type: :loser,
                              #      details: [{
                              #        where: :row,
                              #        index: 1,
                              #        positions: [[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]]
                              #      }]
                              #    }
```

The problem with managing the grid yourself is that there is nothing stopping
you from making bad moves. For example, playing twice.

```ruby
g = Grid.new('xx')
evaluator.analyze(g, Grid::O) # => { status: :invalid_grid,
                              #      type: :too_many_moves_ahead
                              #    }
```

To avoid such situations, let the engine handle game play. Once you tell it who
plays first, then it ensures that the game play follows the rules of
[Tic-tac-toe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

```ruby
e = Engine.new

class EngineObserver

  attr_reader :last_event

  def update(event)
    @last_event = event
  end
end

observer = EngineObserver.new
e.add_observer(observer)

e.start(Grid::O).play(2, 1).play(1, 1).play(2, 2).play(1, 2).play(2, 3)
observer.last_event # => { name: :game_over,
                    #      source: #<XO::Engine...>
                    #      type: :winner,
                    #      last_move: { turn: :o, r: 2, c: 3 },
                    #      details: [{
                    #        where: :row,
                    #        index: 2,
                    #        positions: [[2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 3]]
                    #      }]
                    #    }
```

I also built a [Tic-tac-toe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)
command-line client that uses the library. See how everything comes together by
viewing its implementation right
[here](https://github.com/dwayne/xo/blob/master/bin/xo).

To use the [client](https://github.com/dwayne/xo/blob/master/bin/xo) just type,

```
$ xo
```

on the command-line after installing the gem.

## Performance of the Minimax Algorithm

```ruby
require 'benchmark'
require 'xo/ai/minimax'

puts Benchmark.measure { XO::AI::Minimax.instance }
# => 3.090000   0.000000   3.090000 (  3.091686)
```

## Testing

You can run:

- All specs: `bundle exec rake`, or
- A specific spec: `bundle exec ruby -Ilib -Ispec spec/path_to_spec_file.rb`
